## [0.3.0](https://github.com/lezli01/anal/compare/v0.2.0...v0.3.0) (2026-05-27)

### Added

- New default-on `unused_source_file` rule. It flags Dart source files in
  the analyzed set that are never reached from any entry point via an
  `import`, `export`, or `part` directive. Entry points are files under
  `bin/` or `test/`, files that declare a top-level `main`, and
  `lib/<package>.dart` plus any other file sitting directly under
  `lib/` (i.e. not nested inside `lib/src/`). Generated-file basenames
  such as `*.g.dart` and `*.freezed.dart` are skipped defensively even
  when the runner's default excludes are turned off. Diagnostics are
  emitted at `Severity.warning`. The rule is registered by the built-in
  CLI and enabled automatically. Running `dart run anal` against a
  project that previously produced no diagnostics may now surface new
  warnings from this rule.
- New `MultiFileAnalyzerRule` extension point for custom rules that need
  to reason across multiple files in a single invocation (for example to
  build an import graph or a cross-file symbol index). Multi-file rules
  are registered with the same `RuleRegistry` as `AnalyzerRule`
  implementations and are dispatched once per run with the full set of
  resolved compilation units. Existing `AnalyzerRule` implementations
  continue to be dispatched once per file and do not need any changes.
- New `--no-default-excludes` CLI flag that opts out of the built-in
  default exclude patterns. Pair it with explicit `--exclude` flags when
  you want full control over which paths are skipped.
- New `AnalOptions.defaultExcludePaths` constant exposing the list of
  glob patterns excluded by `AnalOptions.defaults()`. Useful when
  composing custom `AnalOptions` instances programmatically.
- New default-on `unused_function` rule. It flags file-local function
  declarations that are never referenced, specifically private top-level
  functions in libraries that have no `part` files and local function
  declarations inside another function or method body. Diagnostics are emitted
  at `Severity.warning`. The rule is registered by the built-in CLI and enabled
  automatically. Running `dart run anal` against a project that previously
  produced no diagnostics may now surface new warnings from this rule.
- New default-on `unused_class` rule. It flags file-local declarations
  that are never referenced within the same compilation unit, covering
  `class`, `mixin`, `enum`, and `extension type` declarations whose names
  begin with `_`. The rule only runs against libraries that have no
  `part` files and skips declarations annotated with
  `@pragma('vm:entry-point')`. Diagnostics are emitted at
  `Severity.warning`. The rule is registered by the built-in CLI and
  enabled automatically. Running `dart run anal` against a project that
  previously produced no diagnostics may now surface new warnings from
  this rule.
- Open-source project guidance, issue templates, pull request checklist,
  security policy, code of conduct, and Dependabot configuration.
- Coverage artifact upload to CI.
- `.pubignore` to keep automation and assistant-only files out of the published
  package archive.
- `.gitattributes` for predictable text file line endings.

### Changed

- Updated CI and release automation to target the repository default branch.
- Tightened package metadata for pub.dev discovery.
- Widened the analyzer dependency to `>=9.0.0 <13.0.0` so projects using
  `freezed >=3.2.5` can add `anal` without a version-solver conflict.
- Default exclude patterns now include `*.g.dart` and `*.freezed.dart`.
  Pass an empty `excludePaths` (or `--no-default-excludes` on the CLI)
  to opt out.
- `--exclude` now layers on top of the default excludes instead of
  replacing them. Patterns you pass are added to the built-in defaults;
  use `--no-default-excludes` if you need to suppress the defaults.

### Fixed

- Fixed directory include discovery on Windows.
- `anal` is now installable alongside `freezed ^3.2.5`.
- `dart run anal --version` now prints the correct package version
  instead of the stale hardcoded `0.1.0`.
- Restored analyzer 9.0.0 compatibility for the `unused_class` rule.
  The rule previously reached into `ExtensionTypeDeclaration.primaryConstructor`,
  which only exists in analyzer 10+, causing a build break for consumers
  pinned to analyzer 9.0.0 (`'primaryConstructor' isn't defined for the type
  'ExtensionTypeDeclaration'`). The rule now uses the cross-version
  `ExtensionTypeDeclaration.name` accessor.

## 0.1.0

- Added a pluggable static-analysis framework for Dart and Flutter projects:
  - `AnalyzerRule`: abstract plugin contract for custom rules.
  - `Diagnostic`, `Severity`, `SourceLocation`: value types describing
    analysis findings.
  - `AnalysisContext`: carrier passed into each rule invocation, exposing the
    resolved compilation unit.
  - `RuleRegistry`: in-memory registration and lookup of rules, with
    duplicate-id rejection.
  - `AnalysisRunner`: orchestrator that resolves target files, dispatches
    rules, and collects diagnostics.
  - `AnalOptions`: value class describing include/exclude paths and enabled
    rule ids.
  - `Reporter` / `ConsoleReporter`: pluggable diagnostic output, with a stdout
    implementation.
  - CLI executable `anal` (`dart run anal`) with `--help`, `--version`,
    `--rules`, and `--exclude` flags.

### BREAKING CHANGE

- Removed the `Calculator` stub that shipped in `0.0.1`. Consumers that
  depended on it must remove the import; it was a generator placeholder and
  not part of any intended public API.

## 0.0.1

- Initial package scaffold.
