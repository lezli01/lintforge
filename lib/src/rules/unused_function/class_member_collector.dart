/// Collector for instance- and static-member methods, operators, getters,
/// and setters declared on classes, mixins, enums, and extension types.
///
/// Every [MethodDeclaration] member of a [ClassDeclaration],
/// [MixinDeclaration], [EnumDeclaration], or [ExtensionTypeDeclaration]
/// is a candidate. The [_Candidate.kindLabel] is picked from the
/// declaration's shape:
///
/// * `setter` when [MethodDeclaration.isSetter] is `true`.
/// * `getter` when [MethodDeclaration.isGetter] is `true`.
/// * `operator` when [MethodDeclaration.operatorKeyword] is non-null.
/// * `static method` when [MethodDeclaration.isStatic] is `true`.
/// * `method` otherwise.
///
/// A member is exempt when it is `external` or carries
/// `@pragma('vm:entry-point')`. The collector additionally skips every
/// member of a class, mixin, enum, or extension type when the
/// enclosing declaration — or any class / mixin / interface reached
/// through `extends`, `with`, `implements`, or mixin `on` clauses —
/// declares its own `noSuchMethod`, because such a type can intercept
/// any otherwise-missing call by name and the rule cannot tell whether
/// a member is unused or routed through `noSuchMethod`. The walk also
/// recognises mocktail's `Fake` and `Mock` base classes by simple
/// name, since the analyzed sources typically do not pull in
/// `package:mocktail` as a resolved dependency. See
/// [_enclosingDeclaresNoSuchMethod].
///
/// To avoid duplicate noise with `unused_class`, the rule's dispatch
/// site additionally skips a candidate when its enclosing type is a
/// private declaration whose element is itself absent from the global
/// reference index — `unused_class` already flags that type, and
/// re-flagging every member of it would just repeat the report.
///
/// An `@override` member is additionally skipped when its inherited
/// supertype member is either declared outside the analyzed unit set
/// or is itself reachable; see [_overridesReachableSupertypeMember]
/// for the exact rules. This catches framework callback overrides
/// (`State.build`, `Object.toString`, etc.) as well as in-repo
/// abstract-base / concrete-subtype dispatch.
///
/// The diagnostic anchor is the member's name [Token].
