/// Collector for constructor declarations on classes and enums.
///
/// Every [ConstructorDeclaration] member of a [ClassDeclaration] or
/// [EnumDeclaration] is a candidate, covering generative, named, factory,
/// and redirecting forms. The synthetic unnamed constructor the analyzer
/// inserts when a class declares no constructors is intentionally not
/// considered: this collector only iterates AST nodes, and that
/// constructor has no [ConstructorDeclaration] in the source.
///
/// A constructor is exempt when it is `external` or carries
/// `@pragma('vm:entry-point')`. The collector additionally skips every
/// constructor on a class or enum when the enclosing declaration — or
/// any class / mixin / interface reached through `extends`, `with`,
/// `implements`, or mixin `on` clauses — declares its own
/// `noSuchMethod`, because such a type can intercept any
/// otherwise-missing call by name and the rule cannot tell whether a
/// constructor is truly unused or invoked through reflection / dynamic
/// dispatch on its enclosing type. The walk also recognises mocktail's
/// `Fake` and `Mock` base classes by simple name, since the analyzed
/// sources typically do not pull in `package:mocktail` as a resolved
/// dependency. See [_enclosingDeclaresNoSuchMethod].
///
/// Every constructor of a [ClassDeclaration] whose metadata carries a
/// `@freezed`, `@Freezed(...)`, `@unfreezed`, `@Unfreezed(...)`, or
/// `@FreezedUnion(...)` annotation is likewise skipped — the boilerplate
/// constructors `package:freezed` expects (private generative `Foo._()`,
/// unnamed forwarding factory, and one named factory per union case)
/// are only invoked from generated `*.freezed.dart` parts, which are
/// usually absent when the rule runs. See [_hasFreezedAnnotation].
///
/// To avoid duplicate noise with `unused_class`, the rule's dispatch
/// site additionally skips a constructor candidate when its enclosing
/// class element is itself absent from the global reference index —
/// `unused_class` already flags that class, and re-flagging every
/// constructor of it would just repeat the report.
///
/// The diagnostic anchor is the constructor's name [Token] for named
/// constructors (e.g. `named` in `MyClass.named()`), and the class name
/// [Token] for the unnamed default constructor (e.g. `MyClass` in
/// `MyClass();`).
