/// Flags function-shaped declarations that are never referenced across
/// the analyzed file set.
///
/// The rule is a [MultiFileAnalyzerRule]: it is dispatched once per
/// analysis run with every resolved compilation unit in scope, so it
/// can resolve references that cross file boundaries. The following
/// kinds of declarations are inspected, each by a dedicated collector:
///
/// * **Top-level functions** — private declarations (identifier begins
///   with `_`) unconditionally, and public declarations only when the
///   unit lives under a package's `lib/src/` directory. In both cases
///   the enclosing library must have no `part` files, because
///   otherwise a sibling part could legitimately reference the
///   function. See [_TopLevelFunctionCollector].
/// * **Top-level getters and setters** — same privacy + `lib/src/` and
///   no-`part`-files rule as top-level functions. See
///   [_TopLevelAccessorCollector].
/// * **Local function declarations** — functions declared inside
///   another function or method body. See [_LocalFunctionCollector].
/// * **Constructor declarations** on classes and enums (generative,
///   named, factory, and redirecting forms). See
///   [_ConstructorCollector].
/// * **Class, mixin, enum, and extension-type members** — instance
///   methods, `static` methods, operators, getters, and setters. See
///   [_ClassMemberCollector].
/// * **Extension members** declared inside `extension Foo on T {}`
///   blocks — methods, `static` methods, operators, getters, and
///   setters. See [_ExtensionMemberCollector].
///
/// A declaration is considered "used" if its [Element] appears in the
/// global reference set built by [_GlobalReferenceCollector], which
/// walks every unit in the [MultiFileAnalysisContext] and registers
/// the resolved element of every reference-bearing AST node — including
/// tear-offs, named-type references, constructor invocations and
/// redirects, operator and index expressions, explicit member accesses,
/// setter writes, the constructor invoked by each enum-value
/// declaration (parameterised enums like
/// `enum Route { home('/'); const Route(this.path); }` call the
/// constructor once per declared value but produce no
/// [InstanceCreationExpression] / [ConstructorName] AST node — the
/// reference is only reachable via
/// [EnumConstantDeclaration.constructorElement]), and the *implicit*
/// super-constructor target of every generative subclass constructor
/// (super-parameter forwarding, `B({super.x})`, produces no
/// [SuperConstructorInvocation] node but still chains to the supertype
/// at runtime; classes that declare no constructors of their own also
/// get a synthetic default constructor that implicitly invokes super).
///
/// The rule deliberately ignores the library's `main` entry point,
/// public top-level functions / getters / setters declared outside
/// `lib/src/`, `external` declarations of any shape, declarations
/// annotated with `@pragma('vm:entry-point')`, and (for top-level
/// function and accessor candidates) any declaration in a library that
/// has `part` files.
///
/// To avoid duplicate noise with the `unused_class` rule, a member
/// candidate is also skipped when its enclosing class, mixin, enum,
/// extension type, or extension is itself a private, unreferenced
/// declaration: `unused_class` already flags that enclosing
/// declaration, and re-flagging every member of it would just repeat
/// the report.
///
/// Additional dispatch-site exemptions cover language features that
/// can reach members through reflection or dynamic dispatch:
///
/// * **Overrides of reachable supertype members.** When a
///   [MethodDeclaration] overrides an inherited supertype member that is
///   either declared outside the analyzed unit set (e.g. `dart:*`,
///   `package:flutter`, any package that did not make it into the
///   [MultiFileAnalysisContext]) or is itself present in the global
///   reference set, the rule treats the override as a "use" of the
///   candidate. No explicit `@override` annotation is required — a
///   declaration that shadows a supertype member is an override whether
///   or not it is annotated, and framework callbacks
///   (`State.createState`, `Widget.createElement`, lifecycle hooks) are
///   routinely written without the annotation. This catches framework
///   callback overrides as well as in-repo abstract base / concrete
///   subtype dispatch where the base member is statically referenced.
///   The check resolves the overridden member via
///   [InterfaceElement.getInheritedMember] with a by-name fallback
///   across the full supertype chain, so equivalent reasoning applies
///   uniformly to methods, operators, getters, and setters.
/// * **`noSuchMethod`-declaring classes/mixins.** When the enclosing
///   class or mixin — or any of its supertypes reached through
///   `extends`, `with`, `implements`, or mixin `on` clauses — declares
///   its own `noSuchMethod`, every undefined call lands in
///   `noSuchMethod` rather than a "no such method" error, so any
///   member name might legitimately be invoked dynamically. The rule
///   skips member and constructor candidates of such enclosing
///   declarations to avoid false positives. Because the analyzed
///   sources typically do not pull in `package:mocktail`, any
///   supertype whose simple name is `Fake` or `Mock` is treated as a
///   `noSuchMethod`-declaring ancestor regardless of whether its body
///   is visible.
/// * **Libraries that import `dart:mirrors`.** The `dart:mirrors`
///   library can invoke arbitrary methods by name at runtime, so any
///   member of an analyzed library that imports `dart:mirrors` is
///   treated as potentially used. The rule skips member and
///   constructor candidates declared in such libraries.
/// * **Constructors of freezed-annotated classes.** When a
///   [ClassDeclaration] carries a `@freezed`, `@Freezed(...)`,
///   `@unfreezed`, `@Unfreezed(...)`, or `@FreezedUnion(...)`
///   annotation (or the prefixed-identifier form,
///   `@freezed_annotation.freezed` / `@freezed_annotation.Freezed`),
///   `package:freezed`'s code generator stamps the class with
///   boilerplate constructors — a private generative `Foo._()`, an
///   unnamed factory forwarding to a generated `_$Foo`, and one named
///   factory per union case — that are only invoked from generated
///   code (typically a `*.freezed.dart` part file). Consumers of
///   `lintforge` often run the rule before code generation has happened,
///   so the source AST shows those constructors as unreferenced even
///   though they will be reached from generated output. The rule
///   skips every constructor candidate of such a class to avoid that
///   false-positive churn without requiring the generated parts to
///   be present.
/// * **Units stamped with the generated-code marker
///   `// ignore_for_file: type=lint`.** Build-time codegen tools —
///   most prominently Flutter's `gen_l10n` for `output-localization-file`
///   output — stamp this line comment at the top of every file they
///   emit to tell the SDK analyzer to suppress all lints on the
///   generated code. The rule treats the marker as a "this file is
///   generated, do not flag" signal and skips every candidate
///   collector for the unit.
/// * **Conditional-export/import branch targets.** A conditional
///   directive (`export 'stub.dart' if (dart.library.html)
///   'x_web.dart';`) resolves to exactly one branch at analysis time,
///   so declarations and members in the *non-selected* branch files are
///   reached only through the wrapper library's public export surface
///   and look unreferenced. The rule collects the file path of every
///   configuration branch URI of any export/import directive across the
///   analyzed unit set and skips every candidate declared in such a
///   file — the whole file is treated as part of the platform export
///   surface. See [_conditionalBranchTargetPaths].
///
/// **Features that flow through existing visitors with no extra
/// handling.** The following language features do not need
/// rule-specific support — the existing reference visitors already
/// pick up the references they generate:
///
/// * **Deferred imports** (`import '…' deferred as p;`) — references
///   through the prefix still resolve to the same library elements
///   that a normal import would, and land via [PrefixedIdentifier] /
///   [PropertyAccess] visits.
/// * **Conditional imports** (`if (…) '…'`) — only one branch is
///   chosen by the analyzer; references through the resolved branch
///   land via the standard visitors.
/// * **`sealed`, `base`, `interface`, and `final` class modifiers** —
///   these change subtyping rules but produce ordinary
///   [ClassDeclaration] nodes whose members and uses look the same to
///   the visitor as a plain `class`.
/// * **Mixins (`mixin`, `mixin class`)** — declared via
///   [MixinDeclaration] / [ClassDeclaration] and processed by the
///   existing class-member collector. `with` clauses are visited as
///   [NamedType]s and pick up the references through that path.
/// * **`const` constructors** — declared via [ConstructorDeclaration]
///   like any other constructor and used through
///   [InstanceCreationExpression] / [ConstructorName] visits.
