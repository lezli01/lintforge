/// Flags function-shaped declarations that are never referenced across
/// the analyzed file set.
///
/// The rule is a [MultiFileAnalyzerRule]: it is dispatched once per
/// analysis run with every resolved compilation unit in scope, so it
/// can resolve references that cross file boundaries. The following
/// kinds of declarations are inspected, each by a dedicated collector:
///
/// * **Top-level functions** — private declarations (identifier begins
///   with `_`) unconditionally, and public declarations only when the
///   unit lives under a package's `lib/src/` directory. In both cases
///   the enclosing library must have no `part` files, because
///   otherwise a sibling part could legitimately reference the
///   function. See [_TopLevelFunctionCollector].
/// * **Top-level getters and setters** — same privacy + `lib/src/` and
///   no-`part`-files rule as top-level functions. See
///   [_TopLevelAccessorCollector].
/// * **Local function declarations** — functions declared inside
///   another function or method body. See [_LocalFunctionCollector].
/// * **Constructor declarations** on classes and enums (generative,
///   named, factory, and redirecting forms). See
///   [_ConstructorCollector].
/// * **Class, mixin, enum, and extension-type members** — instance
///   methods, `static` methods, operators, getters, and setters. See
///   [_ClassMemberCollector].
/// * **Extension members** declared inside `extension Foo on T {}`
///   blocks — methods, `static` methods, operators, getters, and
///   setters. See [_ExtensionMemberCollector].
///
/// A declaration is considered "used" if its [Element] appears in the
/// global reference set built by [_GlobalReferenceCollector], which
/// walks every unit in the [MultiFileAnalysisContext] and registers
/// the resolved element of every reference-bearing AST node — including
/// tear-offs, named-type references, constructor invocations and
/// redirects, operator and index expressions, explicit member accesses,
/// and setter writes.
///
/// The rule deliberately ignores the library's `main` entry point,
/// public top-level functions / getters / setters declared outside
/// `lib/src/`, `external` declarations of any shape, declarations
/// annotated with `@pragma('vm:entry-point')`, and (for top-level
/// function and accessor candidates) any declaration in a library that
/// has `part` files.
///
/// To avoid duplicate noise with the `unused_class` rule, a member
/// candidate is also skipped when its enclosing class, mixin, enum,
/// extension type, or extension is itself a private, unreferenced
/// declaration: `unused_class` already flags that enclosing
/// declaration, and re-flagging every member of it would just repeat
/// the report.
///
/// Additional dispatch-site exemptions cover language features that
/// can reach members through reflection or dynamic dispatch:
///
/// * **Overrides of reachable supertype members.** When a
///   [MethodDeclaration] carries an `@override` annotation and the
///   inherited supertype member is either declared outside the
///   analyzed unit set (e.g. `dart:*`, `package:flutter`, any package
///   that did not make it into the [MultiFileAnalysisContext]) or is
///   itself present in the global reference set, the rule treats the
///   override as a "use" of the candidate. This catches framework
///   callback overrides (`State.build`, `Widget.createElement`, etc.)
///   as well as in-repo abstract base / concrete subtype dispatch where
///   the base member is statically referenced. The check uses
///   [InterfaceElement.getInheritedMember] to resolve the overridden
///   member, so equivalent reasoning applies uniformly to methods,
///   operators, getters, and setters.
/// * **`noSuchMethod`-declaring classes/mixins.** When the enclosing
///   class or mixin — or any of its supertypes reached through
///   `extends`, `with`, `implements`, or mixin `on` clauses — declares
///   its own `noSuchMethod`, every undefined call lands in
///   `noSuchMethod` rather than a "no such method" error, so any
///   member name might legitimately be invoked dynamically. The rule
///   skips member and constructor candidates of such enclosing
///   declarations to avoid false positives. Because the analyzed
///   sources typically do not pull in `package:mocktail`, any
///   supertype whose simple name is `Fake` or `Mock` is treated as a
///   `noSuchMethod`-declaring ancestor regardless of whether its body
///   is visible.
/// * **Libraries that import `dart:mirrors`.** The `dart:mirrors`
///   library can invoke arbitrary methods by name at runtime, so any
///   member of an analyzed library that imports `dart:mirrors` is
///   treated as potentially used. The rule skips member and
///   constructor candidates declared in such libraries.
/// * **Units stamped with the generated-code marker
///   `// ignore_for_file: type=lint`.** Build-time codegen tools —
///   most prominently Flutter's `gen_l10n` for `output-localization-file`
///   output — stamp this line comment at the top of every file they
///   emit to tell the SDK analyzer to suppress all lints on the
///   generated code. The rule treats the marker as a "this file is
///   generated, do not flag" signal and skips every candidate
///   collector for the unit.
///
/// **Features that flow through existing visitors with no extra
/// handling.** The following language features do not need
/// rule-specific support — the existing reference visitors already
/// pick up the references they generate:
///
/// * **Deferred imports** (`import '…' deferred as p;`) — references
///   through the prefix still resolve to the same library elements
///   that a normal import would, and land via [PrefixedIdentifier] /
///   [PropertyAccess] visits.
/// * **Conditional imports** (`if (…) '…'`) — only one branch is
///   chosen by the analyzer; references through the resolved branch
///   land via the standard visitors.
/// * **`sealed`, `base`, `interface`, and `final` class modifiers** —
///   these change subtyping rules but produce ordinary
///   [ClassDeclaration] nodes whose members and uses look the same to
///   the visitor as a plain `class`.
/// * **Mixins (`mixin`, `mixin class`)** — declared via
///   [MixinDeclaration] / [ClassDeclaration] and processed by the
///   existing class-member collector. `with` clauses are visited as
///   [NamedType]s and pick up the references through that path.
/// * **`const` constructors** — declared via [ConstructorDeclaration]
///   like any other constructor and used through
///   [InstanceCreationExpression] / [ConstructorName] visits.
