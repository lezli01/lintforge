/// Flags Dart source files that are never reached from any entry point in the
/// analyzed set.
///
/// The rule is intentionally cross-file: per the frame's multi-file dispatch
/// model, a single invocation sees every resolved compilation unit at once and
/// can reason about reachability between them. The algorithm has four steps:
///
/// 1. **Classify** every analyzed unit's path as an *entry point* or a
///    *non-entry-point candidate*. Entry points are files under `bin/**` or
///    `test/**`, files that declare a top-level `main` function, and files
///    that make up the package's public surface — `lib/<package>.dart` and
///    any other file sitting directly under `lib/` (i.e. not nested in a
///    subdirectory such as `lib/src/`). Everything else, typically
///    `lib/src/**`, is a candidate.
/// 2. **Build a directed graph** in which each unit points to the absolute,
///    normalized paths of every file it pulls in via `ImportDirective`,
///    `ExportDirective`, or `PartDirective` and whose resolved URI lies inside
///    the analyzed set. For an `ImportDirective` or `ExportDirective`, the
///    primary URI is followed alongside the URI of *every* `if (...)`
///    configuration on the directive — conditional imports of the form
///    `import 'foo.dart' if (dart.library.io) 'foo_io.dart'` contribute one
///    edge per alternative regardless of the active platform, so a
///    cross-platform stub and all of its platform-specific implementations
///    are kept reachable in a single multi-file analysis run. Deferred
///    imports (`import 'x.dart' deferred as p`) are handled identically to
///    ordinary imports for reachability purposes. URIs that resolve outside
///    the analyzed set (`dart:` libraries, dependencies, files excluded from
///    the run) are dropped.
/// 3. **Compute reachability** from the entry-point set with a breadth-first
///    search over that graph. A `part of` library is reached transitively
///    once its owning library is reached, because the owning library's
///    `PartDirective` contributes the forward edge to the part file.
/// 4. **Emit** one [Diagnostic] per non-entry-point candidate that is
///    unreachable, located at offset `0` / line `1` / column `1` of the file
///    so the message is anchored at the top of the source.
///
/// Generated files are skipped defensively even though the runner's default
/// excludes already drop common generator outputs, so consumers that disable
/// those defaults still avoid noisy false positives on generated artifacts.
/// This covers conventional generated-file basenames (`*.g.dart`,
/// `*.freezed.dart`) and top-of-file `// ignore_for_file: type=lint` markers.
///
/// Diagnostics are sorted by file path so reports are deterministic for a
/// given input set.
