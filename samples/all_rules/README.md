# `all_rules` sample

A self-contained Dart/Flutter package that exercises **every** built-in rule
shipped by the [`anal`](../..) package in a single project, with the same
breadth of positive and negative cases that each per-rule sample covers.

The sample exists so consumers (and the rules' own contributors) can see all
three rules co-firing on a real `pub get`-resolved tree, and so the reporter's
output for a mixed run is easy to eyeball.

## Layout

```
samples/all_rules/
  pubspec.yaml                       # path-dependent on the root `anal` package
  bin/
    main.dart                        # bin/ entry point — always reachable
  lib/
    all_rules_sample.dart            # lib/<package>.dart entry point
    unused_function_demo.dart        # positive + negative cases for unused_function
    unused_class_demo.dart           # positive + negative cases for unused_class
    src/
      internals.dart                 # public-top-level positive for unused_function
                                     # (`lib/src/` is the package's internal surface)
      used.dart                      # library that declares `part 'used_via_part.dart';`
                                     # and is imported by the entry — reachable
      used_via_part.dart             # `part of 'used.dart';` — reachable transitively
      orphan.dart                    # never imported — UNREACHABLE
```

## Run it

From the repository root:

```sh
fvm dart pub get --directory samples/all_rules
fvm dart run anal samples/all_rules
```

The runner analyses both `lib/` and `bin/` so that the `bin/main.dart`
entry-point negative for `unused_source_file` is exercised alongside the
`lib/` cases.

## Expected output

Exactly **16** diagnostics — 11 `unused_function`, 4 `unused_class`, and 1
`unused_source_file` — and nothing else:

```

```

(Diagnostic ordering depends on the runner's file iteration; the set of
`(file, ruleId)` pairs above is what's deterministic.)

### Negative cases (MUST NOT be flagged)

`unused_function`:

| Tag  | Where                                       | Why the rule skips it                                                                 |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `N1` | `publicTopLevel`                            | Public top-level function in a file directly under `lib/` — part of the package's public surface, reachable from outside the analyzed set. |
| `N2` | `main`                                      | The `main` entry point is exempt by name.                                             |
| `N3` | `_usedPrivate`                              | Referenced as both a direct call and a tear-off in `main`.                            |
| `N4` | `external _externalPrivate`                 | `external` top-level functions are exempt regardless of name.                         |
| `N5` | `@pragma('vm:entry-point')` private         | `@pragma('vm:entry-point')` annotated declarations are exempt regardless of name.     |

Each positive case has a used twin that exercises the negative path for the
same kind:

- `_usedPrivate` (top-level function) — called and torn off from `main`.
- `_usedTopLevelGetter` / `_usedTopLevelSetter` — read / written from `main`.
- `Service.usedMethod`, `Service.usedStaticMethod`, `Service.usedGetter`,
  `Service.usedSetter`, and `Service.operator +` — all referenced from
  `main`.
- `usedLocal` inside `Service.usedMethod` — invoked in its enclosing body.
- `StringX.usedExtension` — invoked from `main`.
- `usedPublicTopLevel` in `lib/src/internals.dart` — invoked from `main`.

`unused_class`:

| Tag  | Why it is silent                                                                   |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `N1` | `PublicClass` — only private (`_`-prefixed) declarations are inspected.            |
| `N2` | `_UsedAsType` is referenced as a parameter type annotation.                        |
| `N3` | `_UsedAsExtends` is referenced in an `extends` clause.                             |
| `N4` | `_UsedAsImplements` is referenced in an `implements` clause.                       |
| `N5` | `_UsedAsIs` is referenced in an `is` check.                                        |
| `N6` | `_UsedAsAs` is referenced in an `as` cast (and as a return type).                  |
| `N7` | `_UsedStatic` is referenced via static-member access (`_UsedStatic.value`).        |
| `N8` | `class _Alias = _AliasBase with _AliasMixin;` — `ClassTypeAlias` is out of scope.  |
| `N9` | `extension _Ext on int {}` — non-type `extension` declarations are out of scope.   |
| `N10`| `@pragma('vm:entry-point')` annotated `_EntryClass` is exempted by the rule.       |

`unused_source_file`:

| File                              | Why the rule skips it                                              |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `bin/main.dart`                   | `bin/` entry point — always reachable.                             |
| `lib/all_rules_sample.dart`       | sits directly under `lib/`, so the rule treats it as an entry point. |
| `lib/src/used.dart`               | imported by `lib/all_rules_sample.dart` (a `lib/` direct-child entry point). |
| `lib/src/used_via_part.dart`      | `part of 'used.dart';` — reachable transitively via the entry-point → `used.dart` → `used_via_part.dart` chain. |
