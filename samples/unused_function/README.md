# `unused_function` sample

A self-contained Dart/Flutter package that exercises the
[`unused_function`](../../lib/src/rules/unused_function_rule.dart) rule
shipped by the [`anal`](../..) package.

The sample exists so consumers (and the rule's own contributors) can see
exactly which declarations the rule flags and which it deliberately ignores,
running against a real `pub get`-resolved project.

## Layout

```
samples/unused_function/
  pubspec.yaml                       # path-dependent on the root `anal` package
  lib/unused_function_sample.dart    # entry point; covers every flagged kind
                                     # except the public top-level function case
  lib/src/internals.dart             # public-but-unreferenced top-level function
                                     # (`lib/src/` is the package's internal
                                     # surface, so public declarations there
                                     # are candidates)
  lib/src/mirrors_user.dart          # negative case for the `dart:mirrors`
                                     # exemption — every member of every class
                                     # in a library that imports `dart:mirrors`
                                     # is exempt from the rule
  lib/src/l10n/l10n.dart             # negative case for the
  lib/src/l10n/l10n_en.dart          # `// ignore_for_file: type=lint`
                                     # exemption — mocks the synthetic
                                     # `L` base class and per-locale
                                     # subclass that `flutter gen-l10n`
                                     # emits under
                                     # `output-localization-file`; every
                                     # candidate in either unit is
                                     # skipped because of the generated-
                                     # code marker at the top of the file
  lib/src/refs.g.dart                # excluded via `--exclude '*.g.dart'`;
                                     # parsed but never reportable. Calls
                                     # `keptAliveByExcludedRef` so the
                                     # cross-file rule's global reference
                                     # set still sees that use (N21)
```

## Run it

From the repository root:

```sh
fvm dart pub get --directory samples/unused_function
fvm dart run anal --exclude '*.g.dart' samples/unused_function/lib
```

The `--exclude '*.g.dart'` flag filters `lib/src/refs.g.dart` out of the
*reportable* set so its own private members (e.g. `_refUsage`) are not
flagged, while the frame still parses the file so its references — like
the call to `keptAliveByExcludedRef` — flow into the cross-file rule's
global reference set. See `N21` below.

## Expected output

Thirteen `unused_function` diagnostics — and nothing else:

### Positive cases (MUST be flagged)

| Tag   | Where                                       | Why it triggers                                                                       |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `P1`  | top-level `_unusedPrivateTopLevel`          | Private top-level function with no reference in the analyzed set.                     |
| `P2`  | top-level getter `_unusedTopLevelGetter`    | Private top-level getter that is never read. (See note above re: the duplicate label.) |
| `P3`  | top-level setter `_unusedTopLevelSetter`    | Private top-level setter that is never written. (See note above re: the duplicate label.) |
| `P4`  | `Service._unusedPrivateMethod`              | Private instance method with no reference anywhere.                                   |
| `P5`  | `Service.unusedStaticMethod`                | Static method with no reference anywhere.                                             |
| `P6`  | `Service.unusedGetter`                      | Instance getter that is never read.                                                   |
| `P7`  | `Service.unusedSetter`                      | Instance setter that is never written.                                                |
| `P8`  | `Service.operator -`                        | Operator that is never invoked.                                                       |
| `P9`  | local `unusedLocal` inside `Service.usedMethod` | Local function with no reference in its enclosing body.                           |
| `P10` | `StringX.unusedExtension`                   | Method on a public extension that is never invoked.                                   |
| `P11` | `unusedPublicTopLevel` in `lib/src/internals.dart` | Public top-level function in `lib/src/`. Files under `lib/src/` are the package's internal surface, so public top-level declarations there are candidates. |
| `P12` | `IsolatedSub.overrideButUnreachable`         | `@override` whose inherited supertype member is in the analyzed set but itself unreferenced — the override-of-reachable exemption does not apply, so the method is still flagged. |
| `P13` | `NoSuchMethodTarget.foo`                     | Concrete method on a class whose supertype chain does NOT declare `noSuchMethod` — the supertype-walking exemption does not apply, so the unused member is still flagged. Acts as the positive control for the `noSuchMethod` walk. |

### Negative cases (MUST NOT be flagged)

| Tag   | Where                                                      | Why the rule skips it                                                                 |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `N1`  | `publicTopLevel`                                           | Public top-level function in a file directly under `lib/` — part of the package's public surface, reachable from outside the analyzed set. |
| `N2`  | `main`                                                     | The `main` entry point is exempt by name.                                             |
| `N3`  | `_usedPrivate`                                             | Referenced as both a direct call and a tear-off in `main`.                            |
| `N4`  | `external _externalPrivate`                                | `external` top-level functions are exempt regardless of name.                         |
| `N5`  | `@pragma('vm:entry-point')` private                        | `@pragma('vm:entry-point')` annotated declarations are exempt regardless of name.     |
| `N6`  | `Service.objectPatternGetter`                              | Used only via an object-pattern destructure — the new `visitPatternField` hook counts the resolved getter element as a reference. |
| `N7`  | `Service.recordGetter`                                     | Used inside a record literal that is destructured by a record pattern — `visitRecordLiteral` and `visitRecordPattern` descend through both forms. |
| `N8`  | `Service.cascadedMethod`                                   | Invoked from `main` via a cascade (`service..cascadedMethod()`) — cascade sections flow through the recursive visitor. |
| `N9`  | `Service.call`                                             | Invoked from `main` via the implicit `.call` (`service()`); `visitFunctionExpressionInvocation` records the `call` element as a use. |
| `N10` | every member of `NoSuchMethodHolder`                       | The class declares its own `noSuchMethod`, which can intercept any call by name at runtime — the rule skips every member and the constructor. |
| `N11` | every member of `MirrorsHostedService` in `lib/src/mirrors_user.dart` | The library imports `dart:mirrors`, which can invoke arbitrary members by name — the rule skips every member and constructor declared in the unit. |
| `N12` | every abstract getter on `L` in `lib/src/l10n/l10n.dart` and every concrete `@override` getter on `LEn` in `lib/src/l10n/l10n_en.dart` | Each file is stamped with the de-facto Dart "this is generated" marker `// ignore_for_file: type=lint` at the top, which `flutter gen-l10n` writes into every file it emits — the rule treats the marker as a unit-level exemption and skips every candidate collector for the unit. |
| `N13` | `Greeter.build` extending `StatelessWidgetStub` | `@override` of an in-repo abstract supertype member that is itself referenced through `this` from the base class (`render()` calls `build()`) — the supertype member is in the global reference set, so the override is treated as a use. |
| `N14` | `Sub.hook` extending `Base`                  | `@override` of an in-repo abstract supertype member that is invoked from the base class (`Base.run` calls `hook()` through implicit `this`) — same override-of-reachable exemption as N13. |
| `N15` | `_FakeService.foo` extending `_Fake` implementing `NoSuchMethodTarget` | `_Fake` declares its own `noSuchMethod`; the supertype-walking exemption inspects `_FakeService.allSupertypes`, finds `_Fake.noSuchMethod`, and skips every member of `_FakeService`. Mocktail's `Fake` / `Mock` simple names are recognised the same way even when the base library is not part of the analyzed set. |
| `N16` | `_C.foo` extending `_B extends _A` (two-hop) | `_A` declares `noSuchMethod`, `_B extends _A` forwards the override implicitly, `_C extends _B implements NoSuchMethodTarget`. The walk transitively finds `_A.noSuchMethod` through `_B`, so `_C.foo` is exempt despite neither `_B` nor `_C` declaring `noSuchMethod` directly. |
| `N17` | `Box<T>.put` and `Box<T>.peek` called through `IntBox` | Generic-class members invoked through a non-generic subtype resolve to a substituted "member view" of the declared element. Both the candidate set and the global reference set are projected through `Element.baseElement` so the declared member matches the call site. Without normalisation `Box.put` and `Box.peek` would be flagged. |
| `N18` | `Holder<int>.value(0)`                       | Factory constructor on a generic sealed class invoked with an explicit type argument resolves to a substituted view of the declared constructor; the same `baseElement` projection lets the declared factory match the call site. |
| `N19` | `A.new` reached through `B`'s `super.x` forwarding (`class B extends A { const B({super.x}); }` plus `const B(x: 1)`) | Super-parameter forwarding (Dart 2.17+) produces no `SuperConstructorInvocation` AST node — the forwarding is expressed only through the `super.x` parameter. The rule reads the implicit super-constructor target off the constructor element and records it as a use, so `A`'s constructor must NOT be flagged. Also covers classes that declare no constructor of their own: the synthetic default constructor implicitly invokes super, and the `visitClassDeclaration` hook records that super target. |
| `N20` | `Route`'s `const Route(this.path)` constructor on a parameterised enum (`enum Route { home('/'), settings('/settings'); const Route(this.path); final String path; }` plus `Route.home.path`) | Each enum-value declaration invokes the enum's constructor at const-evaluation time, but the AST does NOT model that as an `InstanceCreationExpression` / `ConstructorName` — the call is implicit in the `EnumConstantDeclaration` node and only reachable via `node.constructorElement`. The new `visitEnumConstantDeclaration` hook records that target, so the constructor must NOT be flagged. |
| `N21` | `keptAliveByExcludedRef` in `lib/src/internals.dart` is referenced only from the excluded `lib/src/refs.g.dart` (the runner is invoked with `--exclude '*.g.dart'`) | Excluded files are filtered out of the *reportable* set but still parsed by the frame, so their references flow into the cross-file rule's global reference set. The call in `refs.g.dart` keeps `keptAliveByExcludedRef` alive — without the excluded-files-as-references behavior, this public top-level function in `lib/src/` would be a P11-shaped positive. The excluded file's own private members (e.g. `_refUsage`) are likewise not flagged because the file is not in `reportableFilePaths`. |

Each positive case has a used twin that exercises the rule's negative
path for the same kind:

- `_usedPrivate` (top-level function) — called and torn off from `main`.
- `_usedTopLevelGetter` / `_usedTopLevelSetter` — read / written from `main`.
- `Service.usedMethod`, `Service.usedStaticMethod`, `Service.usedGetter`,
  `Service.usedSetter`, and `Service.operator +` — all referenced from
  `main`.
- `usedLocal` inside `Service.usedMethod` — invoked in its enclosing
  body.
- `StringX.usedExtension` — invoked from `main`.
- `usedPublicTopLevel` in `lib/src/internals.dart` — invoked from `main`.
